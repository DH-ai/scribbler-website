We will look at a few examples of using JavaScript for computational physics. You can experiment with a few of them using this notebook: [Notebook for Physics Visualization](https://app.scribbler.live/?jsnb=github:gopi-suvanam/scribbler/examples/Phsyics-Visualization.jsnb).

## Example 1: Solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

To illustrate the use of JavaScript in computational physics, let's start with some basic numerical methods: solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and performing simple simulations. 

Consider the simple harmonic oscillator, described by the differential equation:

d^2x/dt^2 + ω^2*x = 0 

This can be broken down into two first-order ODEs:

dx/dt = v 
dv/dt = -ω^2*x

We can solve these using the Euler method, a straightforward numerical approach. Here is a JavaScript example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Simple Harmonic Oscillator</title>
    <script>
        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
            const omega = 1.0;
            let x = 1.0;  // Initial position
            let v = 0.0;  // Initial velocity
            const dt = 0.01;
            const numSteps = 1000;
            let positions = [];

            for (let i = 0; i < numSteps; i++) {
                let newX = x + v * dt;
                let newV = v - omega * omega * x * dt;
                x = newX;
                v = newV;
                positions.push(x);
            }

            console.log(positions);
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Simple Harmonic Oscillator Simulation</h1>
    <p>Open the console to see the results.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

This script initializes the position and velocity of the oscillator and iteratively updates them using the Euler method. The results are logged to the console. For more details look at: [Exploring Differential Equations Solving with JavaScript](https://scribbler.live/2024/05/11/Differential-Equations-JavaScript.html).

## Example 2: Visualizing the Harmonic Oscillator

To better understand the oscillator's behavior, we can visualize the position over time using an HTML canvas and JavaScript.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Harmonic Oscillator Visualization</title>
    <style>
        canvas {
            border: 1px solid black;
        }
    </style>
    <script>
        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
            const canvas = document.getElementById('oscillatorCanvas');
            const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
            const omega = 1.0;
            let x = 1.0;
            let v = 0.0;
            const dt = 0.01;
            const numSteps = 1000;
            const positions = [];

            for (let i = 0; i < numSteps; i++) {
                let newX = x + v * dt;
                let newV = v - omega * omega * x * dt;
                x = newX;
                v = newV;
                positions.push(x);
            }

            ctx.beginPath();
            ctx.moveTo(0, canvas.height / 2);

            for (let i = 0; i < positions.length; i++) {
                ctx.lineTo(i * canvas.width / positions.length, canvas.height / 2 - positions[i] * 100);
            }

            ctx.stroke();
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Harmonic Oscillator Visualization</h1>
    <canvas id="oscillatorCanvas" width="800" height="400"></canvas>
</body>
</html>
```

In this script, we draw the oscillator's position over time on an HTML canvas. This visual representation helps in understanding the periodic motion of the oscillator.


## Example 3: Particle System with Three.js
For more advanced simulations, such as those involving particle systems or complex fields, JavaScript libraries like Three.js can be invaluable. Below is an example of using Three.js to simulate and visualize a simple particle system.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Particle System Simulation</title>
    <style>
        body { margin: 0; }
        canvas { display: block; }
    </style>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
            const scene = new THREE.Scene();
            const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
            const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
            renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
            document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

            const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
            const particles = 5000;
            const positions = new Float32Array(particles * 3);

            for (let i = 0; i < positions.length; i++) {
                positions[i] = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;
            }

            geometry.setAttribute('position', new THREE.BufferAttribute(positions, 3));
            const material = new THREE.PointsMaterial({ color: 0x888888 });
            const particleSystem = new THREE.Points(geometry, material);
            scene.add(particleSystem);

            camera.position.z = 5;

            function animate() {
                requestAnimationFrame(animate);
                particleSystem.rotation.x += 0.001;
                particleSystem.rotation.y += 0.002;
                renderer.render(scene, camera);
            }

            animate();
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

This example creates a 3D particle system with particles randomly distributed in space. The particle system rotates continuously, providing a dynamic visualization.

Sure! Here are a few more examples that demonstrate the power of JavaScript in computational physics, covering various concepts like projectile motion, chaotic systems, and wave propagation.

## Example 4: Projectile Motion Simulation

Projectile motion is a classic physics problem. We can simulate the trajectory of a projectile under the influence of gravity using JavaScript.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Projectile Motion Simulation</title>
    <style>
        canvas {
            border: 1px solid black;
        }
    </style>
    <script>
        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
            const canvas = document.getElementById('projectileCanvas');
            const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

            const g = 9.81; // Gravity (m/s^2)
            let angle = 45 * Math.PI / 180; // Launch angle (degrees to radians)
            let speed = 50; // Initial speed (m/s)
            let vx = speed * Math.cos(angle);
            let vy = speed * Math.sin(angle);
            const dt = 0.1;
            let x = 0;
            let y = canvas.height;

            function drawProjectile() {
                ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
                ctx.beginPath();
                ctx.arc(x, y, 5, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
                ctx.fill();
                x += vx * dt;
                y -= vy * dt;
                vy -= g * dt;
                if (y >= canvas.height) {
                    y = canvas.height;
                    vx = 0;
                    vy = 0;
                }
                if (x < canvas.width && y >= 0) {
                    requestAnimationFrame(drawProjectile);
                }
            }

            drawProjectile();
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Projectile Motion Simulation</h1>
    <canvas id="projectileCanvas" width="800" height="400"></canvas>
</body>
</html>
```

This example calculates the trajectory of a projectile and animates its motion on an HTML canvas.

                ctx.fill();

                let num1 = -g * (2 * mass1 + mass2) * Math.sin(angle1);
                let num2 = -mass2 * g * Math.sin(angle1 - 2 * angle2);
                let num3 = -2 * Math.sin(angle1 - angle2) * mass2;
                let num4 = angle2Vel * angle2Vel * length2 + angle1Vel * angle1Vel * length1 * Math.cos(angle1 - angle2);
                let den = length1 * (2 * mass1 + mass2 - mass2 * Math.cos(2 * angle1 - 2 * angle2));

                den = length2 * (2 * mass1 + mass2 - mass2 * Math.cos(2 * angle1 - 2 * angle2));
                let angle2Acc = (num1 * num2) / den;

                angle1Vel += angle1Acc * dt;
                angle2Vel += angle2Acc * dt;
