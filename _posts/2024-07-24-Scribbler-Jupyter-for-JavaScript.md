## What is Scribbler?

The world of data science and interactive coding has long been dominated by Jupyter Notebooks, a powerful tool for working with Python and other languages. However, JavaScript developers have been left without a similar platform - until now. Enter Scribbler, a groundbreaking JavaScript notebook tool that brings the power of interactive coding to the world's most popular programming language.

Scribbler is a web-based JavaScript notebook tool that allows developers to write, execute, and share JavaScript code in a notebook environment. With Scribbler, developers can create notebooks that contain a mix of HTML and JavaScript code cells, which can be executed directly in the browser. This innovative approach enables developers to work with JavaScript in a more interactive and collaborative way.

## What is Jupyter

Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's primarily used for data science, scientific computing, and education.

Jupyter's core features:

1. *Notebooks:* Web-based documents that combine code, output, and narrative text.
2. *Interactive Code:* Execute code in over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and JavaScript.
3. *Visualization:* Display plots, charts, and other visualizations inline.
4. *Collaboration:* Share notebooks with others and collaborate in real-time.
5. *Extensibility:* Extend Jupyter with plugins, extensions, and custom kernels.

Jupyter is widely used in:

1. Data Science: For data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.
2. Education: For teaching programming, data science, and scientific computing.
3. Research: For scientific computing, simulations, and data analysis.

Jupyter's benefits include:

1. *Reproducibility:* Share and reproduce results easily.
2. *Interactivity:* Explore and visualize data in real-time.
3. *Collaboration:* Work with others on projects and share knowledge.

In summary, Jupyter is a powerful tool for interactive computing, data science, and education, allowing users to create and share documents that combine code, output, and narrative text.


## Scribbler - The "Jupyter for JavaScript"

Scribbler's notebook-based approach makes it an ideal platform for JavaScript developers who want to experiment with code, visualize data, and share knowledge with others. Just like Jupyter Notebooks, Scribbler provides an interactive environment for coding, debugging, and testing. However, Scribbler takes it a step further by allowing developers to embed notebooks in other web pages, making it easy to share and collaborate on code. Scribbler allows you to write and execute JavaScript code directly in the browser, making it ideal for quick experiments, data visualization, and learning. 

Here are some key features and an overview of how to use it:

### Key Features:
1. **Interactive Coding**: Write and run JavaScript code interactively.
2. **Data Visualization**: Create dynamic visualizations using libraries like D3.js, Plotly, and others.
3. **Notebook Structure**: Organize code, notes, and visualizations in a notebook format.
4. **Export Options**: Export notebooks as HTML or JSON for sharing and collaboration.
5. **Live Preview**: Instant feedback with live previews of code execution.

### Getting Started:
1. **Setup**: Open Scribbler in your browser (https://app.scribbler.live). You can use an online version if available or host it locally.
2. **Create a New Notebook**: Start a new notebook to begin coding.
3. **Write Code**: Type your JavaScript code in the cells provided.
4. **Run Code**: Execute code cells to see the output immediately.
5. **Visualization**: Use libraries like Plotly for creating visualizations. Include the necessary library scripts in your notebook.
6. **Save and Export**: Save your notebook or export it for sharing. Use _File->Save Locally_ or _File->Download_.
7. **Publish to Git**: Push your notebooks to your github repository to publish them through _File->Github_

### Example:
Here's a simple example of using Scribbler to create a sine chart using plotly:

```javascript
range(0,10,0.01).map(Math.sin).plot()
```

### Tips:
- **Libraries**: Make sure to include any necessary libraries by adding script tags as shown in the example.
- **Documentation**: Refer to the documentation of any libraries you use for specific usage instructions.
- **Experiment**: Use Scribbler to experiment with different coding techniques and visualizations.

1. Data Visualization: Use Scribbler to create interactive data visualizations, leveraging popular libraries like D3.js and Chart.js.
2. Code Tutorials: Create step-by-step coding tutorials and share them with others, making it easy to learn and teach JavaScript concepts.
3. Collaborative Coding: Work with others on JavaScript projects in real-time, using Scribbler's collaborative features.
4. Prototyping: Use Scribbler to quickly prototype and test JavaScript ideas, without the need for a full-fledged development environment.

## Scribbler vs Jupyter

Both Scribbler and Jupyter are interactive notebook tools that allow for live coding and visualization, but they cater to different programming languages and use cases. Here's a detailed comparison between the two:

### Scribbler:
**Language Support**: Primarily supports JavaScript.
