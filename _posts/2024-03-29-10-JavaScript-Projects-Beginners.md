## Introduction to JS Projects
JavaScript is a dynamic and versatile programming language widely used for web development. For beginners, hands-on projects are invaluable for reinforcing concepts, building practical skills, and fostering creativity. Whether you're just starting with JavaScript or looking to level up your proficiency, embarking on projects tailored for beginners is a fantastic way to learn and grow. In this article, we'll explore 10 engaging JavaScript projects that cater to beginners, offering a mix of fun and practicality.

## List of JS Projects

### 1. To-Do List Application:
A to-do list application is a quintessential beginner project in JavaScript. It involves creating a user interface where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Through this project, beginners get hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, event handling, and managing application state.

### 2. Weather App:
Building a weather application provides a practical introduction to making API requests and handling JSON data. By fetching weather information based on user input (such as city name), beginners learn how to interact with external APIs, parse data, and dynamically update the UI to display weather forecasts. To experiment with APIs use this notebook: [Test APIs in JavaScript Notebook](https://app.scribbler.live/?jsnb=examples/API-Testing.jsnb)

### 3. Quiz App:
Developing a quiz application introduces beginners to structuring data, managing user input, and implementing scoring mechanisms. By creating a user-friendly interface with multiple-choice questions, beginners gain insights into form validation, feedback mechanisms, and organizing quiz content.

### 4. Budget Tracker:
A budget tracker application allows users to manage their finances by inputting income and expenses. This project teaches beginners about handling user input, performing calculations, and presenting financial data in a clear and organized manner. It's an excellent exercise in data manipulation and user interaction.

### 5. Memory Game:
The classic memory game involves flipping cards to find matching pairs. By creating a memory game application, beginners delve into game logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation for updating the game state. This project offers a fun way to explore JavaScript's capabilities while honing problem-solving skills.

### 6. Calculator:
Developing a calculator application provides a hands-on experience with arithmetic operations and user interface design. Beginners learn to handle user input, implement mathematical functions, and update the display in real-time. This project is a great introduction to building interactive tools with JavaScript.

### 7. Recipe Finder:
A recipe finder application allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients or keywords. By integrating with a recipe API, beginners practice making HTTP requests, processing responses, and presenting recipe data in a visually appealing format. This project combines practical utility with creative exploration.

### 8. GitHub Profile Viewer:
Building a GitHub profile viewer enables users to explore GitHub profiles and repositories. Beginners learn to interact with the GitHub API, handle authentication, and display user information dynamically. This project offers insights into integrating third-party APIs and customizing user experiences.

### 9. Pomodoro Timer:
A Pomodoro timer helps users manage their work and break intervals effectively. By creating a Pomodoro timer application, beginners explore timer functionalities, event-driven programming, and updating the UI based on elapsed time. This project enhances productivity while sharpening JavaScript skills. You can start with a basic timer code here: [Timer Example](https://app.scribbler.live/#./examples/Timer.jsnb)

### 10. Drawing App:
A drawing application allows users to unleash their creativity by sketching and painting on a canvas. By implementing drawing functionalities with JavaScript and HTML5 canvas element, beginners learn about mouse events, rendering graphics, and creating interactive experiences.
