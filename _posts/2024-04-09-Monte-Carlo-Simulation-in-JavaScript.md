## Introduction to Monte Carlo simulation

Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful computational technique used to model and analyze complex systems through random sampling. This method, named after the famous Monte Carlo Casino, leverages randomness to estimate probabilistic outcomes by performing repeated random sampling computations. Originally developed during the Manhattan Project in the 1940s for nuclear weapons research, Monte Carlo simulation has since become a fundamental tool in various fields, including finance, engineering, physics, and computer science.

The Monte Carlo simulation technique was first proposed by scientists like Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann during their work on nuclear physics and random sampling methods in the mid-20th century. The method gained widespread popularity due to its effectiveness in solving complex problems involving probabilistic uncertainty, eventually becoming a cornerstone of modern computational science.

## Method Overview

Monte Carlo simulations rely on generating random samples from probability distributions to approximate numerical results. The basic steps involved in a Monte Carlo simulation are as follows:

1. *Define the Problem*: Identify the system or process to be simulated and specify the relevant parameters and variables.

2. *Generate Random Inputs*: Sample random values for the input variables from their respective probability distributions.

3. *Perform Simulations*: Apply the sampled input values to the model or system and perform computations to obtain the output.

4. *Aggregate Results*: Repeat the simulation process multiple times (iterations) and aggregate the results to estimate statistical properties of interest (e.g., mean, variance).

### Various Methods

Monte Carlo simulation encompasses various methods tailored to specific types of problems:

- *Monte Carlo Integration*: Estimate integrals using random sampling methods like the hit-or-miss or importance sampling techniques.

## JavaScript Code Examples

The examples below give an overview of Monte Carlo Simulation techniques. Use this notebook for experimenting: [Monte Carlo Simulation Notebook](https://app.scribbler.live/#github:gopi-suvanam/scribbler/examples/Monte-Carlo-Simulation.jsnb)

### Example 1: Monte Carlo Simulation for Estimating the Value of π

Let's demonstrate a simple Monte Carlo simulation in JavaScript to estimate the value of π using random sampling in a unit square and circle:

```javascript
function estimatePi(numSamples) {
    let insideCircle = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {
        const x = Math.random(); // Random x-coordinate in [0, 1)
        const y = Math.random(); // Random y-coordinate in [0, 1)

        // Check if the point (x, y) is inside the unit circle
        if (x * x + y * y < 1) {
            insideCircle++;
        }
    }

    // Estimate pi as the ratio of points inside the circle to total points
    const piEstimate = (4 * insideCircle) / numSamples;
    return piEstimate;
}

// Example: Estimate pi using 1 million samples
const numSamples = 1000000;
const estimatedPi = estimatePi(numSamples);
console.log("Estimated value of π:", estimatedPi);
```

In this example:
- We randomly sample points (x, y) within a unit square [0, 1) × [0, 1).
- We count the number of points falling inside the unit circle (centered at the origin with radius 1).
- The estimated value of π is calculated as the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of samples.

Let's expand the JavaScript code examples to include additional Monte Carlo simulations demonstrating different applications. Below are two more examples: one for estimating the area under a curve using Monte Carlo integration and another for simulating a simple game of dice.

### Example 2: Monte Carlo Integration for Area Estimation

Suppose we want to estimate the area under the curve of a given function f(x) within a specified interval [a, b] using Monte Carlo integration:

```javascript
function monteCarloIntegration(func, a, b, numSamples) {
    let areaEstimate = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {
        const x = a + Math.random() * (b - a); // Random x in [a, b]
        const y = func(x); // Evaluate the function at x

        // Check if the point (x, y) is below the curve y = f(x)
        if (Math.random() * (b - a) < y) {
            areaEstimate += 1; // Point is below the curve, count it
        }
    }

    // Estimate the area as the ratio of counted points to total points
    areaEstimate = areaEstimate / numSamples * (b - a);
    return areaEstimate;
}

// Example: Estimate the area under the curve y = x^2 from 0 to 1 using 1 million samples
const func = x => x * x;
const a = 0;
const b = 1;
const numSamples = 1000000;

const estimatedArea = monteCarloIntegration(func, a, b, numSamples);
console.log("Estimated area under the curve y = x^2 from 0 to 1:", estimatedArea);
```

In this example:
- We sample random points (x, y) within the rectangle \([a, b] \times [0, \max(f(x))]\).
- We count the number of points that fall below the curve \( y = f(x) \).
- The estimated area under the curve is calculated as the ratio of points below the curve to the total number of samples.

### Example 3: Monte Carlo Simulation of a Dice Game

Let's simulate a simple dice game using Monte Carlo methods to estimate the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two dice:

```javascript
function rollDice() {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1; // Roll a 6-sided die
}

function simulateDiceGame(numTrials) {
    let countSum7 = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < numTrials; i++) {
        const dice1 = rollDice();
        const dice2 = rollDice();

        // Check if the sum of two dice is equal to 7
        if (dice1 + dice2 === 7) {
            countSum7++; // Count successful outcomes (sum of 7)
        }
    }

    // Estimate the probability of rolling a sum of 7
    const probabilitySum7 = countSum7 / numTrials;
    return probabilitySum7;
}

// Example: Estimate the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two dice using 1 million trials
const numTrials = 1000000;
const estimatedProbability = simulateDiceGame(numTrials);
console.log("Estimated probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two dice:", estimatedProbability);
```

In this example:
- We simulate rolling two six-sided dice repeatedly.
- We count the number of trials where the sum of the dice is equal to 7.
- The estimated probability of rolling a sum of 7 is calculated as the ratio of successful outcomes to the total number of trials.

### 1. **Risk Management and Assessment**

Monte Carlo simulations help financial institutions manage and assess risk by modeling the behavior of assets and portfolios under various scenarios. By simulating thousands of possible future states of the world, institutions can estimate the probability of extreme losses and determine value-at-risk (VaR).

- **Value-at-Risk (VaR)**: VaR is a statistical measure that quantifies the potential loss in the value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval. Monte Carlo simulations generate a distribution of possible portfolio values, from which VaR can be estimated.

- **Stress Testing**: Monte Carlo methods are used to stress test portfolios by simulating adverse market conditions and assessing their impact on portfolio performance. This helps in understanding the resilience of portfolios to market shocks.

### 2. **Option Pricing**

Monte Carlo simulations are extensively used to price complex financial derivatives, especially options with path-dependent features such as Asian options, lookback options, and barrier options.

- **Black-Scholes Model**: While the Black-Scholes model provides a closed-form solution for pricing European options, Monte Carlo simulations are used for options where analytical solutions are not available. By simulating the underlying asset's price path multiple times, the expected payoff of the option can be estimated.

- **American Options**: Monte Carlo methods can handle the early exercise feature of American options by using techniques like least squares Monte Carlo (LSM), which estimates the optimal exercise strategy.
