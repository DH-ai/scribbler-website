## Code Examples of Statistical Analysis in JavaScript

You can use this notebook for experimenting in statistical analysis: [JavaScript Notebook for Statistical Analysis](https://app.scribbler.live/?jsnb=github:gopi-suvanam/scribbler-examples/Statistical-Analysis.jsnb).
To get started, you need to include some JavaScript libraries that provide statistical functions and data visualization capabilities. Some popular libraries include:
- **Simple Statistics**: A library for basic statistical functions.
- **D3.js**: A library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations.
- **Plotly.js**: A library for creating high-quality charts and graphs.

You can include these libraries in your HTML file as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Statistical Analysis in JavaScript</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-statistics@7.7.0/dist/simple-statistics.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="chart"></div>
  <script src="stats.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Create a new file `stats.js` where we will write our statistical analysis code.

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. Let's start with some basic descriptive statistics using the Simple Statistics library.

```javascript
const data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10];

const mean = ss.mean(data);
const median = ss.median(data);
const mode = ss.mode(data);
const variance = ss.variance(data);
const standardDeviation = ss.standardDeviation(data);

console.log(`Mean: ${mean}`);
console.log(`Median: ${median}`);
console.log(`Mode: ${mode}`);
console.log(`Variance: ${variance}`);
console.log(`Standard Deviation: ${standardDeviation}`);
```

### Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics allow us to make inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. Let's perform a t-test to compare the means of two datasets.

```javascript
const sample1 = [2, 3, 5, 6, 9];
const sample2 = [3, 4, 4, 5, 8];

const tTestResult = ss.tTestTwoSample(sample1, sample2);
console.log(`T-Test Result: ${tTestResult}`);
```

### Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis measures the relationship between two variables. Let's calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between two datasets.

```javascript
const x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const y = [2, 4, 5, 4, 5];

const correlation = ss.sampleCorrelation(x, y);
console.log(`Pearson Correlation: ${correlation}`);
```

### Data Visualization

Data visualization is a key aspect of statistical analysis, allowing us to understand data patterns and trends visually. Let's create a scatter plot using Plotly.js.

```javascript
const trace = {
  x: x,
  y: y,
  mode: 'markers',
  type: 'scatter'
};

const layout = {
  title: 'Scatter Plot',
  xaxis: { title: 'X' },
  yaxis: { title: 'Y' }
};

Plotly.newPlot('chart', [trace], layout);
```

### Advanced Statistical Analysis

For more advanced statistical analysis, you can use additional libraries like `jstat`, which provides a wide range of statistical functions.

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jstat/1.9.4/jstat.min.js"></script>
```

Example of performing a linear regression using `jstat`:

```javascript
const A=[[1,2,3],
        [1,1,0],
        [1,-2,3],
        [1,3,4],
        [1,-10,2],
        [1,4,4],
        [1,10,2],
        [1,3,2],
        [1,4,-1]];
const b=[1,-2,3,4,-5,6,7,-8,9];
const model=jStat.models.ols(b,A);

console.log("Coefficients: ",model.coef);
console.log("R-Squared:",model.R2);
console.log("Coeff T-test",model.t.p )
console.log("Model F-test",	model.f.pvalue)
```
