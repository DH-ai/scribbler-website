## What is Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis refers to the process of collecting, exploring, summarizing, and interpreting data to uncover patterns, trends, relationships, and insights. It is a fundamental method used across various disciplines, including science, business, economics, social sciences, and healthcare, to make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions from data.

### Key Components of Statistical Analysis:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. This includes measures such as:

   - **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean, median, and mode, which describe the center or average of a dataset.
   - **Measures of Dispersion**: Range, variance, and standard deviation, which quantify the spread or variability of data points.
   - **Percentiles and Quartiles**: Divisions of data into 100 equal parts or four equal parts, respectively, used to understand the distribution of values.

2. **Inferential Statistics**: Inferential statistics involves making inferences or generalizations about a population based on sample data. This includes:

   - **Hypothesis Testing**: Formal methods to test hypotheses about population parameters using sample data, such as t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance).
   - **Confidence Intervals**: Estimating the range within which population parameters are likely to fall based on sample statistics.
   - **Regression Analysis**: Examining the relationship between variables, where one variable (dependent) is predicted by one or more other variables (independent).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA involves using graphical and statistical techniques to explore data sets and uncover patterns or relationships that may not be immediately obvious. Techniques include histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

4. **Data Mining and Machine Learning**: Advanced statistical techniques involve applying algorithms to large datasets to uncover patterns and insights automatically. This includes clustering, classification, and predictive modeling.

### Applications of Statistical Analysis:

- **Business and Economics**: Market research, forecasting sales, analyzing financial data, and optimizing business processes.
- **Science and Research**: Conducting experiments, analyzing results, and drawing conclusions in fields like biology, physics, and medicine.
- **Social Sciences**: Understanding human behavior through surveys, polls, and demographic data analysis.
- **Healthcare**: Analyzing patient data, clinical trials, and epidemiological studies to improve treatment outcomes and public health strategies.
- **Quality Control and Engineering**: Monitoring production processes, ensuring product quality, and optimizing manufacturing efficiency.

### Importance of Statistical Analysis:

- **Decision Making**: Provides evidence-based support for decision-making processes, reducing uncertainty and minimizing risks.
- **Predictive Insights**: Predicts future trends and outcomes based on historical data and trends.
- **Validation**: Ensures reliability and validity of research findings and conclusions.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Identifies opportunities for process improvement and optimization.

## Code Examples of Statistical Analysis in JavaScript

You can use this notebook for experimenting in statistical analysis: [JavaScript Notebook for Statistical Analysis](https://app.scribbler.live/?jsnb=github:gopi-suvanam/scribbler-examples/Statistical-Analysis.jsnb).
To get started, you need to include some JavaScript libraries that provide statistical functions and data visualization capabilities. Some popular libraries include:
- **Simple Statistics**: A library for basic statistical functions.
- **D3.js**: A library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations.
- **Plotly.js**: A library for creating high-quality charts and graphs.

You can include these libraries in your HTML file as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Statistical Analysis in JavaScript</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-statistics@7.7.0/dist/simple-statistics.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="chart"></div>
  <script src="stats.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Create a new file `stats.js` where we will write our statistical analysis code.

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. Let's start with some basic descriptive statistics using the Simple Statistics library.

```javascript
const data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10];

const mean = ss.mean(data);
const median = ss.median(data);
const mode = ss.mode(data);
const variance = ss.variance(data);
const standardDeviation = ss.standardDeviation(data);

console.log(`Mean: ${mean}`);
console.log(`Median: ${median}`);
console.log(`Mode: ${mode}`);
console.log(`Variance: ${variance}`);
console.log(`Standard Deviation: ${standardDeviation}`);
```

### Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics allow us to make inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. Let's perform a t-test to compare the means of two datasets.

```javascript
const sample1 = [2, 3, 5, 6, 9];
const sample2 = [3, 4, 4, 5, 8];

const tTestResult = ss.tTestTwoSample(sample1, sample2);
console.log(`T-Test Result: ${tTestResult}`);
```

### Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis measures the relationship between two variables. Let's calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between two datasets.

```javascript
const x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const y = [2, 4, 5, 4, 5];

const correlation = ss.sampleCorrelation(x, y);
console.log(`Pearson Correlation: ${correlation}`);
```

### Data Visualization

Data visualization is a key aspect of statistical analysis, allowing us to understand data patterns and trends visually. Let's create a scatter plot using Plotly.js.

```javascript
const trace = {
  x: x,
  y: y,
  mode: 'markers',
  type: 'scatter'
};

const layout = {
  title: 'Scatter Plot',
  xaxis: { title: 'X' },
  yaxis: { title: 'Y' }
};

Plotly.newPlot('chart', [trace], layout);
```

### Advanced Statistical Analysis

For more advanced statistical analysis, you can use additional libraries like `jstat`, which provides a wide range of statistical functions.

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jstat/1.9.4/jstat.min.js"></script>
```

Example of performing a linear regression using `jstat`:

```javascript
const A=[[1,2,3],
        [1,1,0],
        [1,-2,3],
        [1,3,4],
        [1,-10,2],
        [1,4,4],
        [1,10,2],
        [1,3,2],
        [1,4,-1]];
const b=[1,-2,3,4,-5,6,7,-8,9];
const model=jStat.models.ols(b,A);

console.log("Coefficients: ",model.coef);
console.log("R-Squared:",model.R2);
console.log("Coeff T-test",model.t.p )
console.log("Model F-test",	model.f.pvalue)
```
