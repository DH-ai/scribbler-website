## Introduction to Data Visualization in JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile tool for creating interactive and insightful data visualizations in scientific applications. In this article, we explore how to harness the power of JavaScript, specifically using the Plotly.js library, to visualize complex scientific data and demonstrate its applications in various scientific domains.

Data visualization plays a crucial role in scientific research, allowing researchers to explore and communicate complex datasets effectively. JavaScript libraries like Plotly.js provide a user-friendly interface to create interactive charts, graphs, and plots directly within web browsers.

## Basic Example: Creating an Interactive Line Chart with Plotly.js

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Interactive Line Chart Example</title>
    <!-- Include Plotly.js library -->
    <script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- HTML element to render the chart -->
    <div id="lineChart" style="width: 800px; height: 400px;"></div>

    <script>
        // Sample data
        const years = [2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014];
        const values = [30, 40, 35, 45, 50];

        // Create trace for the line chart
        const trace = {
            x: years,
            y: values,
            type: 'scatter',
            mode: 'lines+markers',
            marker: { color: 'steelblue' }
        };

        // Define layout for the chart
        const layout = {
            title: 'Interactive Line Chart',
            xaxis: { title: 'Year' },
            yaxis: { title: 'Value' }
        };

        // Plot the chart
        Plotly.newPlot('lineChart', [trace], layout);
    </script>
</body>
