- **Use Cases**: Analyzing relationships between variables, such as height vs. weight or advertising spend vs. sales.

#### 5. **Histograms**

- **Description**: Histograms represent the distribution of a dataset by dividing it into bins and displaying the frequency of data points within each bin.
- **Use Cases**: Understanding the distribution of data, such as the frequency of test scores or age groups in a population.

#### 6. **Bubble Charts**

- **Description**: Bubble charts are an extension of scatter plots, where each point is replaced with a bubble, and the size of the bubble represents a third variable.
- **Use Cases**: Visualizing multi-dimensional data, such as sales performance (x-axis), profit (y-axis), and market size (bubble size).

#### 7. **Heatmaps**

- **Description**: Heatmaps use color to represent the intensity of data at two-dimensional points.
- **Use Cases**: Identifying patterns and correlations in large datasets, such as website user activity or correlation matrices.

#### 8. **Area Charts**

- **Description**: Area charts are similar to line charts, but the area under the line is filled with color, providing a cumulative visual effect.
- **Use Cases**: Showing cumulative data trends, such as total sales over time or population growth.

#### 9. **Candlestick Charts**

- **Description**: Candlestick charts represent financial data, showing the open, high, low, and close prices for a specific period.
- **Use Cases**: Analyzing financial markets and stock price movements.

#### 10. **Geographical Maps**

- **Description**: Geographical maps visualize data on a geographic layout, representing data points based on location.
- **Use Cases**: Displaying demographic data, sales territories, or geographical trends.

#### 11. **Treemaps**

- **Description**: Treemaps display hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles, with the size of each rectangle representing a data value.
- **Use Cases**: Visualizing hierarchical structures, such as organizational charts or file system sizes.

#### 12. **Sunburst Charts**

- **Description**: Sunburst charts are a radial version of a treemap, representing hierarchical data with concentric circles.
- **Use Cases**: Displaying hierarchical data in a compact and visually appealing way.

#### 13. **Radar Charts**

- **Description**: Radar charts (or spider charts) display multivariate data in a two-dimensional chart with axes starting from the same point.
- **Use Cases**: Comparing multiple variables for a single entity, such as performance metrics or skill levels.

#### 14. **Sankey Diagrams**

- **Description**: Sankey diagrams visualize the flow of resources or information, with the width of the arrows representing the flow quantity.
- **Use Cases**: Analyzing resource flows, such as energy consumption, financial transactions, or user journey on a website.

#### 15. **Chord Diagrams**
