The Scribbler team recently held the *Scribble Pad Hackathon* at IIT-Hyderabad, centered around JavaScript development. The event was organized by the [Lambda Club](https://iith.dev/) and saw participation from students across various disciplines. Participants worked on diverse projects, showcasing practical applications of JavaScript in areas such as AI, game development, and web interfaces. The projects reflected a strong grasp of technical concepts and an ability to apply JavaScript effectively to solve problems and create interactive experiences.

## Highlighting Innovation - Notable Projects from the Hackathon

The Scribble Pad Hackathon showcased the creativity and technical prowess of participants through a diverse range of projects, each demonstrating the power and versatility of JavaScript in innovative ways. Below, we dive into some of the standout projects that emerged from this event, highlighting their unique approaches and practical applications. 

For each project, you can explore the code and functionality directly by accessing the provided Scribbler notebooks. Be sure to take the notebooks out of sandbox mode by clicking the red button (⤯) at the top right corner or by selecting *Edit->Trust the NB*. Once trusted, simply press the play button to run the notebook.

### 1. Jarvis AI Assistant

Inspired by the iconic AI from popular culture, this project aimed to create a personalized assistant that could handle a variety of tasks. The Jarvis AI Assistant is capable of answering user questions, and observing your emotions. The project not only demonstrates the potential of JavaScript in building intelligent systems but also brings a beloved sci-fi concept closer to reality.

### 2. ASCII Art with Advanced Image Manipulation

This project is a fascinating blend of art and technology, transforming live images into intricate ASCII art. The team employed sophisticated image processing techniques to convert pictures into text-based representations, highlighting how JavaScript can be used creatively in visual and artistic applications. The resulting ASCII art is both visually striking and a testament to the advanced capabilities of modern JavaScript.

### 3. Flappy Bird with Voice Amplitude Control

Putting a unique spin on the classic Flappy Bird game, this project introduced voice amplitude control, allowing players to control the bird’s movements using their voice. This innovation added a layer of challenge and fun, as players must modulate their voice to navigate through obstacles. The project is an excellent example of how JavaScript can be used to create interactive, voice-controlled applications that are both entertaining and technically impressive.
