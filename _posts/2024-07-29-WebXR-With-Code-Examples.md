## What is WebXR?

WebXR (Web Extended Reality)  is a powerful API that enables developers to create immersive augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences directly in web browsers. By leveraging WebXR, users can experience rich, interactive content without needing to download standalone applications or use specialized hardware beyond standard AR and VR headsets. This article explores the key aspects of WebXR, its applications, and its benefits.

WebXR standard was developed by the W3C and it provides support for both AR and VR within web browsers. It is designed to replace the older WebVR standard, offering a more comprehensive framework for immersive experiences. WebXR allows developers to build applications that can run on a variety of devices, including desktop and mobile browsers, as well as AR and VR headsets.


### AR vs VR - Understanding the Differences

#### **Augmented Reality (AR)**

**Definition**:
Augmented Reality (AR) overlays digital information on the real world. It enhances the user's perception of reality by adding computer-generated elements such as images, videos, sounds, or other data onto the physical environment.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Real-World Integration**: Combines real and virtual worlds, with virtual elements supplementing the real environment.
- **Interactivity**: Users can interact with both real-world and virtual elements simultaneously.
- **Device Use**: Typically used with smartphones, tablets, and AR glasses (e.g., Microsoft HoloLens).
- **Applications**: Widely used in gaming (e.g., Pokémon Go), navigation (e.g., Google Maps AR), education, retail (e.g., virtual try-ons), and industrial training.

**Pros**:
