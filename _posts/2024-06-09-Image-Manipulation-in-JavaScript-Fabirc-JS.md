## Loading and Displaying an Image Using Fabric.js

Let's start by loading and displaying an image on the canvas.

```html
<script>
    const canvas = new fabric.Canvas('canvas');

    fabric.Image.fromURL('https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irina-Gladkova/publication/253864235/figure/fig3/AS:668627082690571@1536424527359/The-image-shown-here-is-a-300-300-pixel-cropped-section-of-SEVIRI-Band-3-digital-counts.png', function(img) {
        img.set({
            left: 100,
            top: 100,
            angle: 0
        });
        canvas.add(img);
    });
</script>
```

This code initializes a Fabric.js canvas and loads an image from a URL, placing it on the canvas at specified coordinates.

## Cropping an Image

To crop an image, you can use the `cropX`, `cropY`, `width`, and `height` properties.

```html
<script>
    fabric.Image.fromURL('https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irina-Gladkova/publication/253864235/figure/fig3/AS:668627082690571@1536424527359/The-image-shown-here-is-a-300-300-pixel-cropped-section-of-SEVIRI-Band-3-digital-counts.png', function(img) {
        img.set({
            left: 100,
            top: 100,
            angle: 0,
            cropX: 50,
            cropY: 50,
            width: 200,
            height: 200
        });
        canvas.add(img);
    });
</script>
```

This code crops the image to a 200x200 square starting from (50, 50) on the original image.

## Resizing an Image

Resizing can be done by setting the `scaleX` and `scaleY` properties.

```html
<script>
    fabric.Image.fromURL('https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irina-Gladkova/publication/253864235/figure/fig3/AS:668627082690571@1536424527359/The-image-shown-here-is-a-300-300-pixel-cropped-section-of-SEVIRI-Band-3-digital-counts.png', function(img) {
        img.set({
            left: 100,
            top: 100,
            angle: 0,
            scaleX: 0.5,
            scaleY: 0.5
        });
        canvas.add(img);
    });
</script>
```

This resizes the image to half of its original size.

## Rotating an Image

Rotating an image is straightforward using the `angle` property.

```html
<script>
    fabric.Image.fromURL('https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irina-Gladkova/publication/253864235/figure/fig3/AS:668627082690571@1536424527359/The-image-shown-here-is-a-300-300-pixel-cropped-section-of-SEVIRI-Band-3-digital-counts.png', function(img) {
        img.set({
            left: 100,
            top: 100,
            angle: 45
        });
        canvas.add(img);
    });
</script>
```

This rotates the image by 45 degrees.

## Applying Filters to an Image

Fabric.js supports various image filters, such as grayscale, sepia, and brightness. Here's how to apply a grayscale filter:

```html
<script>
    fabric.Image.fromURL('https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irina-Gladkova/publication/253864235/figure/fig3/AS:668627082690571@1536424527359/The-image-shown-here-is-a-300-300-pixel-cropped-section-of-SEVIRI-Band-3-digital-counts.png', function(img) {
        img.filters.push(new fabric.Image.filters.Grayscale());
        img.applyFilters();
        canvas.add(img);
    });
</script>
```

For brightness adjustment, use:

```html
<script>
    fabric.Image.fromURL('https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irina-Gladkova/publication/253864235/figure/fig3/AS:668627082690571@1536424527359/The-image-shown-here-is-a-300-300-pixel-cropped-section-of-SEVIRI-Band-3-digital-counts.png', function(img) {
        img.filters.push(new fabric.Image.filters.Brightness({ brightness: 0.05 }));
        img.applyFilters();
        canvas.add(img);
    });
</script>
```

You can chain multiple filters together:

```html
<script>
    fabric.Image.fromURL('https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irina-Gladkova/publication/253864235/figure/fig3/AS:668627082690571@1536424527359/The-image-shown-here-is-a-300-300-pixel-cropped-section-of-SEVIRI-Band-3-digital-counts.png', function(img) {
        img.filters.push(
            new fabric.Image.filters.Grayscale(),
            new fabric.Image.filters.Brightness({ brightness: 0.05 })
        );
        img.applyFilters();
        canvas.add(img);
    });
</script>
```

        <button id="brightness">Brightness</button>
    </div>
    <script>
        const canvas = new fabric.Canvas('canvas');

        // Load image
        fabric.Image.fromURL('https://via.placeholder.com/300', function(img) {
            img.set({
                left: 100,
                top: 100
            });
            canvas.add(img);

            // Rotate image
            document.getElementById('rotate').addEventListener('click', function() {
                img.set('angle', img.get('angle') + 45);
                canvas.renderAll();
            });

            // Apply grayscale filter
            document.getElementById('grayscale').addEventListener('click', function() {
                img.filters.push(new fabric.Image.filters.Grayscale());
                img.applyFilters();
                canvas.renderAll();
