## Introduction to Numerical Integration
Integration is a fundamental concept in mathematics and is widely used in various fields, including physics, engineering, and data analysis. Numerical methods for integration provide techniques to approximate the definite integral of a function when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain. 

We have looked at various numerical methods in this article: [Numerical Analysis in JavaScript for Scientific/Mathematical Computation](https://scribbler.live/2023/06/07/Numerical-Analysis-in-JavaScript-for-Scientific-Computing.html). Here we look at numerical methods specific to integration.


Numerical integration, a cornerstone of computational mathematics, plays a crucial role in approximating definite integrals that are often analytically intractable. This technique, rooted in calculus and numerical analysis, finds extensive applications across various fields, offering practical solutions where exact solutions are impractical or impossible to obtain. From physics and engineering to finance and biology, numerical integration techniques empower scientists, engineers, and analysts to solve complex problems and make informed decisions. This article explores the diverse applications of numerical integration, highlighting its impact and significance in modern scientific and technological advancements.

At its essence, numerical integration involves approximating the integral of a function \( f(x) \) over a specified interval \([a, b]\). Unlike analytical methods, which find exact solutions using formulas and techniques like antiderivatives, numerical integration uses algorithms to compute approximate values of integrals. These algorithms discretize the interval \([a, b]\) into smaller subintervals and compute the sum of function values within these intervals, adjusting the accuracy based on the desired precision.

Each numerical integration rule employs a different strategy for approximating the integral, with varying levels of accuracy and computational complexity. Understanding the logic behind these rules helps in selecting the appropriate method for different functions and integration tasks.



## Key Methods of Numerical Integration

Several numerical methods exist for approximating integrals, each with its strengths and applications:

- **ReimannSum**: Approximates the definite integral of a function by dividing the interval [a, b] into n subintervals of equal width and computing the sum of the areas of rectangles formed by the function values at sample points within each subinterval

- **Trapezoidal Rule**: Divides the interval into trapezoids and sums the areas under these trapezoids to approximate the integral.
  
- **Simpson's Rule**: Approximates the integrand using quadratic polynomials over small intervals, providing more accurate results than the trapezoidal rule for smooth functions.

- **Monte Carlo Integration**: Uses random sampling to estimate integrals, particularly useful for high-dimensional and complex integrands where deterministic methods may fail.

- **Gaussian Quadrature**: Utilizes weighted sum of function values at specific points (nodes) within the interval, yielding highly accurate results by carefully choosing nodes and weights.

## Riemann Sum
The Riemann Sum approximates the definite integral of a function by dividing the interval [a, b] into n subintervals of equal width and computing the sum of the areas of rectangles formed by the function values at sample points within each subinterval.

Logic:
- Divide the interval [a, b] into n subintervals, each of width dx = (b - a) / n.
- Evaluate the function at sample points within each subinterval (e.g., left endpoint, midpoint, or right endpoint).
- Multiply each function value by the width of the corresponding subinterval (dx).
- Sum up the areas of all rectangles to approximate the integral.


```javascript
// Riemann Sum Implementation
function riemannSum(func, a, b, n) {
    const dx = (b - a) / n;
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const xi = a + i * dx;
        sum += func(xi) * dx;
    }
    return sum;
}

// Example Usage
const f = x => x ** 2; // Function to integrate
const a = 0; // Lower bound
const b = 1; // Upper bound
const n = 1000; // Number of subintervals
const result = riemannSum(f, a, b, n);
console.log('Riemann Sum Result:', result);
```

*Explanation:* The `riemannSum` function approximates the definite integral of a given function `func` over the interval `[a, b]` using `n` subintervals. It calculates the width of each subinterval (`dx`) and sums up the area of rectangles formed by the function values at sample points within each subinterval.

## Trapezoidal Rule
The Trapezoidal Rule is another numerical method that approximates the definite integral by dividing the interval into trapezoids and summing their areas. The Trapezoidal Rule approximates the definite integral by dividing the interval [a, b] into n subintervals and summing the areas of trapezoids formed by adjacent sample points, with the first and last trapezoids including half of the endpoints.


Logic:
- Divide the interval [a, b] into n subintervals, each of width dx = (b - a) / n.
- Evaluate the function at endpoints and sample points within each subinterval.
- Calculate the area of each trapezoid formed by adjacent sample points.
- Sum up the areas of all trapezoids to approximate the integral.


```javascript
// Trapezoidal Rule Implementation
function trapezoidalRule(func, a, b, n) {
    const dx = (b - a) / n;
    let sum = 0.5 * (func(a) + func(b)); // Include endpoints
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        const xi = a + i * dx;
        sum += func(xi);
    }
    return sum * dx;
}

// Example Usage
const result = trapezoidalRule(f, a, b, n);
console.log('Trapezoidal Rule Result:', result);
```

*Explanation:* The `trapezoidalRule` function approximates the definite integral using the Trapezoidal Rule. It sums the areas of trapezoids formed by adjacent sample points, with the first and last trapezoids including half of the endpoints.

## Simpson's Rule 
Simpson's Rule is a more accurate numerical method that approximates the definite integral using quadratic interpolations. It divides the interval [a, b] into an even number of subintervals and sums the areas of quadratic interpolations formed by adjacent sample points.

Logic:
- Divide the interval [a, b] into n subintervals, each of width dx = (b - a) / n.
- Evaluate the function at endpoints and sample points within each subinterval.
- Use quadratic interpolation to approximate the function within each subinterval.
- Calculate the area under each quadratic interpolation curve.
- Sum up the areas of all quadratic interpolations to approximate the integral.

```javascript
// Simpson's Rule Implementation
function simpsonsRule(func, a, b, n) {
    if (n % 2 !== 0) throw new Error('Number of subintervals must be even for Simpson\'s Rule');
    const dx = (b - a) / n;
    let sum = func(a) + func(b); // Include endpoints
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        const xi = a + i * dx;
        sum += 2 * (i % 2 ? 4 : 2) * func(xi);
    }
    return sum * dx / 6;
}

// Example Usage
const result = simpsonsRule(f, a, b, n);
console.log('Simpson\'s Rule Result:', result);
```

*Explanation:* The `simpsonsRule` function implements Simpson's Rule to approximate the definite integral. It sums the areas of quadratic interpolations formed by adjacent sample points, with weights 4 and 2 alternated to account for the endpoints and odd/even indices.

## Monte Carlo Integration Algorithm
Monte Carlo Integration is a numerical method for estimating definite integrals using random sampling. See this article for mode details on Monte-Carlo simulation: [A Guide to Monte Carlo Simulation with JavaScript Examples](https://scribbler.live/2024/04/09/Monte-Carlo-Simulation-in-JavaScript.html).
Here’s how you can implement Monte Carlo Integration in JavaScript:

### Logic:
1. **Generate Random Points**: Generate N random points within the integration limits [a, b] for x and within [0, max(f(x))] for y, where f(x) is the integrand function.

2. **Evaluate Function**: Evaluate the function f(x) at each random point x_i.

3. **Calculate Integral Estimate**: Compute the integral estimate using the average of the function values scaled by the range of x.

4. **Repeat and Average**: Repeat steps 1-3 for multiple iterations and average the results to improve accuracy.

### JavaScript Implementation:

Here’s a simple implementation of Monte Carlo Integration in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Function to perform Monte Carlo Integration
function monteCarloIntegration(func, a, b, N) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        // Generate a random x in the range [a, b]
        let x = a + Math.random() * (b - a);
        // Evaluate the function at x
        let fx = func(x);
        // Accumulate the sum of function evaluations
        sum += fx;
    }
    // Compute the average value and scale by the range [a, b]
    let average = sum / N;
    let integral = (b - a) * average;
    return integral;
}

// Example usage: integrate f(x) = x^2 from 0 to 1
function exampleFunction(x) {
    return x * x;
}

let a = 0; // Lower limit of integration
let b = 1; // Upper limit of integration
let N = 1000000; // Number of random points

// Perform Monte Carlo integration
let result = monteCarloIntegration(exampleFunction, a, b, N);

console.log(`Monte Carlo Integration result: ${result}`);
```

1. **monteCarloIntegration Function**:
   - **Parameters**:
     - `func`: The integrand function f(x) to be integrated.
     - `a`, `b`: Lower and upper limits of integration.
     - `N`: Number of random points (iterations) to use for the estimation.
   - **Steps**:
     - Generate a random x in the range [a,b].
     - Evaluate the function f(X) at the random x.
     - Accumulate the sum of function evaluations over N iterations.
     - Compute the average value of the function evaluations and scale by the range [a, b] to estimate the integral.

2. **Example Usage**:

- **Function Choice**: The method can integrate any continuous function \( f(x) \) over a specified range \([a, b]\).
- **Randomness**: The method's stochastic nature means results may vary slightly with each run, but averaging over multiple runs enhances reliability.

Implementing Monte Carlo Integration in JavaScript provides a flexible and efficient way to approximate integrals, especially useful when analytical solutions are challenging or impractical to derive.


## Gaussian Quadrature

Implementing Gaussian Quadrature in JavaScript involves selecting appropriate nodes and weights for a given integration interval and function. Gaussian Quadrature is a numerical method that achieves high accuracy by carefully choosing these nodes and weights to approximate integrals. Here’s how you can implement Gaussian Quadrature in JavaScript:

### Logic:


1. **Select Quadrature Points and Weights**: Choose nodes x_i and corresponding weights w_i for Gaussian Quadrature. These are selected based on specific orthogonal polynomials (e.g., Legendre polynomials) and the desired number of points n.

2. **Transform Integration Limits**: If necessary, transform the integration limits [a, b] to the standard interval [-1,1] 

3. **Compute Integral Estimate**: Evaluate the integrand f(x) at each transformed node x_i and compute the integral estimate using

### JavaScript Implementation:

Here’s an implementation of Gaussian Quadrature in JavaScript using predefined nodes and weights for a specific number of points \( n \):

```javascript
// Gaussian Quadrature nodes and weights for n=4 (4-point Gaussian Quadrature)
const gaussNodes = [-0.861136, -0.339981, 0.339981, 0.861136];
const gaussWeights = [0.347855, 0.652145, 0.652145, 0.347855];

// Function to perform Gaussian Quadrature Integration
function gaussianQuadratureIntegration(func, a, b, n) {
    let integral = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Map x_i from [-1, 1] to [a, b]
        let xi = ((b - a) * gaussNodes[i] + (b + a)) / 2;
        // Evaluate the function at xi
        let fx = func(xi);
        // Accumulate the integral estimate
        integral += gaussWeights[i] * fx;
    }
    // Scale by the transformation factor (b - a) / 2
    integral *= (b - a) / 2;
    return integral;
}

// Example usage: integrate f(x) = x^2 from 0 to 1 using 4-point Gaussian Quadrature
function exampleFunction(x) {
    return x * x;
}

let a = 0; // Lower limit of integration
let b = 1; // Upper limit of integration
let n = 4; // Number of points for Gaussian Quadrature

// Perform Gaussian Quadrature integration
let result = gaussianQuadratureIntegration(exampleFunction, a, b, n);

console.log(`Gaussian Quadrature Integration result: ${result}`);
```

### Explanation:

1. **gaussianQuadratureIntegration Function**:
   - **Parameters**:
     - `func`: The integrand function f(x) to be integrated.
     - `a`, `b`: Lower and upper limits of integration.
     - `n`: Number of points (nodes) and weights to use for Gaussian Quadrature. Here, we use a pre-defined set for n=4.
   - **Steps**:
     - Transform each node x_i from the standard interval [-1,1] to the integration interval [a, b].
     - Evaluate the function f(x) at each transformed node x_i.
     - Compute the integral estimate by summing the products of weights w_i and function values f(x_i).
     - Scale the result by (b-a)/2 to account for the transformation factor.

2. **Example Usage**:
   - Define an example function f(x)=x^2.
   - Set the integration limits a=0 and b=1.
   - Use n=4 for 4-point Gaussian Quadrature, which provides accurate results for polynomials up to degree 2n-1.

   - The result is printed to the console, showing the estimated value of the definite integral of f(x) = x^2 from 0 to 1 using Gaussian Quadrature.

### Considerations:

- **Accuracy**: Gaussian Quadrature achieves high accuracy for smooth functions and is especially effective for polynomials.
- **Node Selection**: Different numbers of points n and corresponding nodes and weights are used depending on the desired accuracy and integration interval.
- **Transformation**: Adjustments may be necessary for integration over non-standard intervals to map nodes correctly.

Implementing Gaussian Quadrature in JavaScript provides a robust method for accurately approximating integrals across various disciplines, from physics and engineering to finance and computational sciences.
