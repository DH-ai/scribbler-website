1. **Scene (`<a-scene>`):**
   - The container for all 3D content.
   - Defines the 3D space where objects are placed.

2. **Entity (`<a-entity>`):**
   - The fundamental building block in A-Frame.
   - Represents objects, lights, cameras, and other elements within the scene.

3. **Components:**
   - Attributes added to entities to define their behavior and appearance.
   - Examples include geometry, material, position, rotation, and scale.

### Example Code

Here is a basic example of an A-Frame scene:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>A-Frame Example</title>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.2.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="0 1.5 -5" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="2 2.5 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="-1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="#ECECEC"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- An `<a-scene>` tag defines the 3D scene.
- `<a-box>`, `<a-sphere>`, `<a-cylinder>`, and `<a-plane>` tags define geometric shapes with various positions, rotations, and colors.
- An `<a-sky>` tag creates a sky background for the scene.

    <script>
      // Create the scene
      const scene = new THREE.Scene();

      // Create a camera
      const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
      camera.position.z = 5;

      // Create a renderer
      const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
      renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
      document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

      // Create a cube
      const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
      const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
      const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
      scene.add(cube);

      // Animation loop
      function animate() {
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);

        // Rotate the cube
        cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
        cube.rotation.y += 0.01;

        renderer.render(scene, camera);
      }

      animate();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- A 3D scene is created with a camera and a renderer.
- A green cube is added to the scene.
- The cube is animated to rotate continuously.
