## JavaScript Image Editing with Canvas

Let's set up a basic HTML file with a canvas element where we'll perform our image editing. The `<canvas>` element is a part of HTML5 that provides a powerful, low-level way to draw graphics directly within a web page. It is a versatile tool used for rendering both 2D and 3D graphics, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive visual content.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML5 Image Editing with JavaScript</title>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="imageCanvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This example defines a `<canvas>` element with an ID of "imageCanvas" and dimensions of 500 pixels by 500 pixels.

```html
<canvas id="imageCanvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
```

### Attributes of `<canvas>` Element

- **id="imageCanvas":** The `id` attribute assigns a unique identifier to the canvas element, allowing it to be easily referenced and manipulated using JavaScript.
- **width="500":** Sets the width of the canvas in pixels.
- **height="500":** Sets the height of the canvas in pixels.

### Key Features of the `<canvas>` Element

1. **Drawing API:**
   - The `<canvas>` element itself is a container for graphics; you must use JavaScript to draw the graphics.
   - It provides a rich set of drawing APIs for shapes, text, images, and more.

2. **2D Context:**
   - The 2D context is the primary drawing interface for 2D graphics.
   - It provides methods and properties to draw and manipulate graphics on the canvas.

3. **WebGL for 3D Graphics:**
   - The `<canvas>` element can also be used with WebGL for rendering 3D graphics.
   - WebGL is a JavaScript API that allows GPU-accelerated 3D graphics to be rendered within a web browser.

### How to Use the `<canvas>` Element

1. **Setting Up the Canvas:**
   - To start drawing, you first need to get a reference to the canvas and its context.
   
   ```javascript
   const canvas = document.getElementById('imageCanvas');
   const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
   ```

2. **Drawing Shapes:**
   - Example: Drawing a rectangle.
   
   ```javascript
   ctx.fillStyle = 'green';
   ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 100);
   ```

3. **Drawing Text:**
   - Example: Drawing text.
   
   ```javascript
   ctx.font = '30px Arial';
   ctx.fillText('Hello Canvas', 50, 50);
   ```

4. **Drawing Images:**
   - Example: Drawing an image.
   
   ```javascript
   const img = new Image();
   img.onload = function() {
     ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, 500, 500);
   };
   img.src = 'path/to/image.jpg';
   ```

5. **Advanced Manipulations:**
   - You can use transformations, patterns, gradients, and more to create complex and dynamic graphics.

### Practical Applications of the `<canvas>` Element

1. **Data Visualization:**
   - Create interactive charts and graphs.
   - Example: Libraries like Chart.js and D3.js use `<canvas>` to render complex visualizations.

Now, let's delve into our JavaScript code to perform various image editing operations. You can explore these examples in this notebook: [Notebook for HTML5 Image Processing](https://app.scribbler.live/?jsnb=./examples/HTML5-Image-Processing.jsnb).

## Example: Drawing Shapes on the Canvas

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('imageCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

// Draw a rectangle
ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 100);

// Draw a circle
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(200, 200, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.fill();
```

In this example, we draw shapes directly onto the canvas using the Canvas API, showcasing the flexibility of HTML5 for creating graphical elements.



## Example: Applying Filters to Images

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('imageCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
const image = new Image();

image.onload = function() {
    // Draw the loaded image onto the canvas
    ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    // Apply filters
    applyFilter('grayscale');
    // Other filter options: 'sepia', 'blur', 'brightness', 'contrast', 'hue-rotate'

    function applyFilter(filter) {
        ctx.filter = `${filter}(100%)`;
        ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    }
};
```

This JavaScript code uses the HTML5 `<canvas>` element to draw a blue rectangle and a red circle. Let's break down each part of the code to understand how it works.

#### 1. Getting the Canvas Element and Context

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('imageCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```

- **`const canvas = document.getElementById('imageCanvas');`**
  - This line selects the `<canvas>` element with the ID `imageCanvas` from the DOM.
  - `document.getElementById('imageCanvas')` returns a reference to the canvas element.

- **`const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');`**
  - This line gets the 2D rendering context for the canvas.
  - `canvas.getContext('2d')` returns an object that provides methods and properties for drawing and manipulating graphics on the canvas.

#### 2. Drawing a Rectangle

```javascript
ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 100);
```

- **`ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';`**
  - Sets the fill color to blue for all subsequent drawing operations.
  - `fillStyle` is a property of the 2D context that defines the color, gradient, or pattern to use inside shapes.

- **`ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 100);`**
  - Draws a filled rectangle on the canvas.
  - The `fillRect` method takes four parameters: `x` (x-coordinate of the upper-left corner), `y` (y-coordinate of the upper-left corner), `width`, and `height`.

#### 3. Drawing a Circle

```javascript
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(200, 200, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.fill();
```

- **`ctx.beginPath();`**
  - Begins a new path, which is a list of points that are connected by lines or curves.
  - This method resets the current path to start a new shape.

- **`ctx.arc(200, 200, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);`**
  - Adds an arc to the current path to create a circle.
  - The `arc` method takes five parameters:
    - `x` (x-coordinate of the circle's center).
    - `y` (y-coordinate of the circle's center).
    - `radius` (radius of the circle).
    - `startAngle` (starting angle, in radians, from where to start drawing the arc, measured from the positive x-axis).
    - `endAngle` (ending angle, in radians, at which to end drawing the arc).

- **`ctx.fillStyle = 'red';`**
  - Sets the fill color to red for all subsequent drawing operations.
  - Changes the `fillStyle` property to 'red' to fill the circle with this color.

- **`ctx.fill();`**
  - Fills the current path with the fill color.
  - This method paints the interior of the circle with the color defined in `fillStyle`.



## Example: Cropping Images

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('imageCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
const image = new Image();

image.onload = function() {
    // Draw the loaded image onto the canvas
    ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    // Crop the image
    cropImage(50, 50, 200, 200);

    function cropImage(x, y, width, height) {
        ctx.drawImage(image, x, y, width, height, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    }
};

image.src = 'example.jpg'; // Replace 'example.jpg' with the path to your image
```

This JavaScript code loads an image, draws it onto an HTML5 canvas, and then crops a specified portion of the image to fit the canvas. Let's break down each part of the code to understand how it works.

#### 1. Getting the Canvas Element and Context

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('imageCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```

- **`const canvas = document.getElementById('imageCanvas');`**
  - This line selects the `<canvas>` element with the ID `imageCanvas` from the DOM.
  - `document.getElementById('imageCanvas')` returns a reference to the canvas element.

- **`const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');`**
  - This line gets the 2D rendering context for the canvas.
  - `canvas.getContext('2d')` returns an object that provides methods and properties for drawing and manipulating graphics on the canvas.

#### 2. Loading the Image

```javascript
const image = new Image();
```

- **`const image = new Image();`**
  - Creates a new `Image` object.
  - This object represents the image to be loaded and drawn onto the canvas.

#### 3. Handling Image Load Event

```javascript
image.onload = function() {
    // Draw the loaded image onto the canvas
    ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    // Crop the image
    cropImage(50, 50, 200, 200);

    function cropImage(x, y, width, height) {
        ctx.drawImage(image, x, y, width, height, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    }
};
```

- **`image.onload = function() { ... }`**
  - Sets an event handler that is called when the image has finished loading.
  - This function ensures that the image is fully loaded before attempting to draw it on the canvas.

- **`ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);`**
  - Draws the entire loaded image onto the canvas.
  - The `drawImage` method takes the image and specifies the destination coordinates and dimensions (in this case, filling the entire canvas).

- **`cropImage(50, 50, 200, 200);`**
  - Calls the `cropImage` function to crop the image.
  - The arguments `50, 50, 200, 200` specify the rectangle within the original image to be cropped.

- **`function cropImage(x, y, width, height) { ... }`**
  - Defines a function to crop the image.
  - This function uses the `drawImage` method to draw the specified rectangle from the original image onto the canvas.

- **`ctx.drawImage(image, x, y, width, height, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);`**
  - Draws the cropped portion of the image onto the canvas.
  - The first four parameters (`x, y, width, height`) specify the source rectangle in the original image.
  - The last four parameters (`0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height`) specify the destination rectangle on the canvas, effectively stretching the cropped image to fill the entire canvas.

#### 4. Setting the Image Source

```javascript
image.src = 'example.jpg'; // Replace 'example.jpg' with the path to your image
```

- **`image.src = 'example.jpg';`**
  - Sets the source of the image.
  - This triggers the loading of the image from the specified path (`'example.jpg'`).
