In the fast-paced world of web development, the ability to quickly prototype and experiment with ideas is crucial. Scribbler, an innovative JavaScript notebook, has emerged as a powerful tool for developers, data scientists, and hobbyists alike. This article explores how Scribbler enables rapid prototyping by combining experimentation, extensibility, and flexibility, making it an ideal choice for modern web projects.

## Experimentation Made Easy

Scribbler shines as an experimentation platform. By providing an interactive environment directly in the browser, it allows developers to iterate quickly on their ideas. Whether you're testing out a new algorithm, designing a user interface, or exploring a dataset, Scribbler’s notebook interface lets you write and run code in small, manageable chunks. The immediate feedback loop helps in refining concepts without the need for complex setups or deployments.

This seamless experimentation is particularly valuable in the early stages of a project, where ideas are fluid, and requirements are still being defined. Scribbler’s simplicity encourages a trial-and-error approach, making it easier to explore different solutions and converge on the best one.

## Combining HTML and JavaScript

One of Scribbler’s standout features is its ability to combine HTML and JavaScript effortlessly. This integration is crucial for web developers who need to prototype full-stack applications quickly. With Scribbler, you can write HTML and JavaScript side by side, creating interactive web pages on the fly. 

For example, you can start by sketching out the structure of a webpage using HTML, then add dynamic behaviors using JavaScript—all within the same notebook. This combination allows for rapid testing of user interactions, animations, and other client-side logic, making it easier to see how different elements of a web application come together.

## Extensibility Through ES6 Libraries

Scribbler is built with modern JavaScript in mind, supporting ES6 and beyond. This means you have access to the vast ecosystem of ES6 libraries, which can be easily integrated into your prototypes. Whether you need to manipulate the DOM, perform complex data manipulations, or leverage advanced visualization tools, the extensive library support ensures that Scribbler can handle it all.

The ability to import and use these libraries directly in your Scribbler notebooks makes it a powerful tool for creating complex prototypes. For example, you can quickly build a dashboard by combining a charting library like Plotly.js with a UI framework like Bootstrap, all while managing logic with libraries like lodash.

## Embeddability of Notebooks

Prototypes are often shared with stakeholders, and Scribbler makes this process straightforward with its embeddability features. You can easily embed Scribbler notebooks into websites, blogs, or documentation. This allows others to interact with your prototype, providing feedback or exploring the code themselves.

Embedding a Scribbler notebook in a webpage is as simple as copying and pasting a snippet of code. This feature is especially useful for educational content, technical blogs, or any scenario where you want to demonstrate code and its output together. It also enables collaborative prototyping, where multiple developers can contribute to the same notebook.

Scribbler makes it easy to share your work by allowing you to embed your notebooks directly into other applications or websites using an `<iframe>`. This feature is particularly useful for showcasing interactive prototypes, demonstrations, or educational content.

### Embedding the Output

If you prefer to embed only the output of the notebook (hiding the code and interface), you can use the following code:

```html
<iframe src="https://app.scribbler.live/sandbox.html#./examples/Hello-world.jsnb" height="400" width="100%" style="width:100%;border: thin solid black;" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation allow-popups"></iframe>
```

- **What it does**: This code embeds just the output of the notebook. The `sandbox.html` in the URL ensures that only the output is displayed, without the full Scribbler interface.
- **Attributes**:
  - `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation allow-popups"`: This attribute restricts the embedded content to a sandboxed environment, providing additional security by limiting the actions the content can perform.

### Embedding a Notebook Directly from GitHub

You can also embed a Scribbler notebook directly from a GitHub repository. Here’s how you can do it:

```html
<iframe id="sandbox" style="width:100%;height:100%" src ="https://app.scribbler.live/sandbox.html?jsnb=github:user/repository/path-to-file"></iframe>
```

- **What it does**: This code embeds a notebook from a specified GitHub repository. Replace `user/repository/path-to-file` with the appropriate GitHub username, repository name, and path to the notebook file.
- **Flexibility**: This method is great for sharing notebooks that are still under development or for distributing example notebooks that others can use.


## Exporting to JavaScript and HTML

Once your prototype is ready, Scribbler doesn’t lock you into its environment. Instead, it offers the ability to export your work to standard JavaScript and HTML files. This export functionality is crucial for transitioning from the prototyping phase to production.

The ability to export code means that your prototype can serve as the foundation for the final product. You can take the exported files, integrate them into a larger codebase, or deploy them directly as part of a web application. This smooth transition from prototype to production reduces the time and effort needed to bring your ideas to life.

### Downloading Code as a JavaScript File
For users who wish to extract the code in their notebooks, Scribbler offers the option to download the code as a single JavaScript file. By selecting the "Download as JS" option, the code in cells is saved as a standalone JavaScript file. This capability facilitates code reuse, archiving, and further development outside the notebook environment. The exported JS file can be used in other projects.

### Exporting as HTML
Scribbler provides the ability to export the current notebook as an HTML file. By selecting the "Download as HTML" option, the notebook is saved as an HTML file on the local machine. HTML cells will be displayed as rendered HTML, while code cells will display both the code and the output as HTML. This export option is particularly useful for sharing notebooks with individuals who do not have access to the notebook interface but still need to view the content. The HTML can be loaded into a webserver to work as a Webapp.

### Downloading Output as HTML
In scenarios where only the output of the notebook is required, users can download the output as an HTML file. By selecting the "Download only output as HTML" option, the current notebook's output is saved as an HTML file on the local machine. This feature allows users to extract and share the results of their notebook without including the underlying code. The static HTML can be used for demo purposes and documentation.
