# Overview

> This is a [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-docs-theme) based on [mistic100's modification](https://github.com/mistic100/jekyll-bootstrap-doc) of the official Bootstrap documentation from a few years back.

Jekyll Docs Theme is provided as a theme for writing documentation for your projects instead of having a single large README file or several markdown files stored in a not so user-friendly manner.

This theme is still in development but is kept fairly stable; just note, there are a lot things yet to come.

# Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-docs-theme"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's _config.yml:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-docs-theme
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install jekyll-docs-theme
```

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Warning:** Custom [themes are not supported on GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/themes/) at the time of writing this, so you may either build your site on another platform or simply fork this repo and build upon it as you would any other theme.
</div>

# Configuration Options

A sample [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-docs-theme/blob/master/docs/_config.yml) file is available with all of the available fields; documentation and more information for each of those fields is available below.
