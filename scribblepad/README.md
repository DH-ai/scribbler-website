## Description of Projects by Participants
### WebGL and Audio visualizaion
This project is about using WebGL to run shader programs and make simple shader programs to generate fractals and a music visualizer based on Perlin noise (with feature extraction from audio as a preprocessing step). Using WebGL allows one to leverage the GPU, enabling the creation of complex but real-time and interactive graphics. Interactivity (via user actions such as mouse movements) is an important aspect of this project.

### Pixel Game
Our project is an enthusiast for young kids who are in their initial stages of learning to colour and draw. It allows them to create pixelated image using their imagination or using the templates provided. It gives them infinite choices for colours to mix and match and create their endless possibilities. This tool provides a very easy to use environment which is extremely suitable for small kids who cannot deal with fancy user interface. It helps them experiment and gives satisfying results to them which helps them unleash their creativity to the fullest. 

### Scribbler_NB
We built 3 notebooks each one of serving a different purpose. 
- Logistic Map - This notebook is based on 2nd degree polynomial mapping we chose how complex chaotic behavior can arise from simple dynamical equations. Used to simulate population based on growth rate and initial populations.
- Matrix Calculator - This notebook is based on very simple equations to calculate addition subtraction multiplication with time complexity n^2  and also using library math.js to calculate additional things like determinant and inverse as well as addition subtraction and much more.
- Reinforcement Learning - This notebook is based on very popular q value optimization algorithm. It is used to predict the color which suits best with the grey background according to user preference on the base of user liking simulated by 'good button' and disliking simulated by 'bad  button' and with multiple inputs it tries to improve it self over and over.

### Chaos Theory and Strange Attractors
We plot differential equations on the canvas of html5 and we show various chaos theory attractions like Chen attraction and Lorentz attraction. There are various button on the site which can speed up/down the plotting as well as create a new plot, etc. 

The website is running on this link: https://sam-martis.github.io/ChaosTheoryAttractors/

### Baby Snake
The Baby Snake project is a simple web-based snake game where players control a snake using keyboard arrow keys.

### Facial Expression Recognition
Our project is a model which is trained and used to detect the mood of a person by his facial expressions in an image.
